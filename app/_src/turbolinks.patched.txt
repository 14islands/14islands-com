Turbolinks doesn't work with Livereload the way it is injected from
grunt-contrib-connect, and gives a blank page after navigating to a new page.

To fix this we need to modify turbolinks not to re-execute the livereload script
on each page load.


Modification: check the name of the script src and never execute livereload:

Line 106:
unless script.src.search /livereload/ > -1
