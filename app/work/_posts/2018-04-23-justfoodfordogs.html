{% include casestudy-header.html about="JustFoodForDogs makes healthy and hand crafted food for dogs in their premium kitchens based in California, USA. They asked us to design and develop a full-blown subscription service so their customers could easily get dog food delivered on a regular basis." %}

## On a mission towards healthy dog lives.

Dogs bring tons of love and joy to their owners and we wanted to show that same personal feeling and playfulness in every step of the experience.

At the same time, we wanted to communicate transparency and expertise that play a big part in the quality of JustFoodForDog's products. We paired detailed pictures of the real food with animations and some dog love to show personality and bring the service to life.

## A personalised meal plan

Because every dog has different needs we created a personalised experience that recommends the best recipe to every customer depending on their dog‚Äôs profile.
We wanted that flow to be a delightful moment for the owners, where they answer simple questions and learn interesting facts on their pets and the recipes in return.

More than the recipe, the recommendation engine calculates quantities based on energetic needs, frequency of delivery and estimated delivery dates.

Through their account, the users can always overview and manage their upcoming deliveries, recipes, pets, profile and payments at any time after purchase.

## The modern toolset

We had to build many parts to bring a full subscription service to life. A performant marketing site with an interactive signup flow and account pages to manage plans, profile & deliveries. We even built an admin tool for their back-office to provide good support to customers.

It was important for us to create a scalable platform for JFFD to grow on. All business logic is built as a re-usable API which handles everything from subscriptions and payments to deliveries and sending customer emails.
