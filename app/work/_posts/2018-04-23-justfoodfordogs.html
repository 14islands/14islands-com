## On a mission towards healthy dog lives.

Dogs bring tons of love and joy to their owners and we wanted to show that same personal feeling and playfulness in every step of the experience.

At the same time, we wanted to communicate transparency and expertise that play a big part in the quality of JustFoodForDog's products. We paired detailed pictures of the real food with animations and some dog love to show personality and bring the service to life.

## A personalised meal plan

Because every dog has different needs we created a personalised experience that recommends the best recipe to every customer depending on their dog‚Äôs profile.
We wanted that flow to be a delightful moment for the owners, where they answer simple questions and learn interesting facts on their pets and the recipes in return.

More than the recipe, the recommendation engine calculates quantities based on energetic needs, frequency of delivery and estimated delivery dates.

Through their account, the users can always overview and manage their upcoming deliveries, recipes, pets, profile and payments at any time after purchase.

## Creative Tech

This project featured a true separation of concerns with the front-end communicating with a custom build API, built from scratch with the best back-end practices in mind.

We picked the most modern and suiting front-end & back-end stack we could think of - which also made building this project a lot of fun :)
