## About

Tictail is a Stockholm-based startup that enables people with great products to easily sell online. Their goal was to build a modern website to  present the Tictail brand, to increase signups and importantly, help their community to succeed. 

The site is fully responsive and built in Wordpress to make all content editable by the people at Tictail.

## Designs

The site was designed by our friends at [Studio Källbom](http://www.studiokallbom.se/). Studio Källbom is a talented design studio with an artistic touch.

The site features a magazine like design: nice typography, bold colors and rich content to show features and tell Tictails story. We were totally inspired to make this our best work ever.

We worked in close collaboration with Tictail, often at their offices. 

Here is a picture from a Friday meeting where our very own Marco gave update about the progress to the people at Tictail.
