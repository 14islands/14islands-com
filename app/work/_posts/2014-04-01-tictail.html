## Crafting it

The site experience is fully responsive for all devices and features nice interactions to make it pleasant to explore. The focus is on the content - making it easy for people to signup to Tictail.

We also put a lot of effort into performance to keep it as fast as possible. The site was built in Wordpress so all content is fully editable by the people at Tictail.

## Design

The site was designed by our friends at [Studio KÃ¤llbom](http://www.studiokallbom.se/), a talented design studio with an artistic touch.

  {% markdown %}
The site features a magazine-like design; nice typography, bold colors and rich content to show features and tell Tictails story. We were totally inspired to make this our best work to date.

## Making it happen
We worked in close collaboration with Tictail, often at their offices. Being able to test out ideas and get quick feedback made the process more enjoyable for all and it was a key element for its end result.
