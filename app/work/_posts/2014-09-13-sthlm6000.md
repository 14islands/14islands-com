# Sthlm6000+

Improving student housing in Stockholm
by increasing building projects to at least 6000.

[Video about project]

## About

Sthlm6000+ is an urban development project that brings together large number of players in Stockholm; among other municipalities, construction companies, real estate companies, architects, government agencies, educational institutions and students. 

The goal of the site is to present this project in a good way and provide information to the public. The site is built responsive in Wordpress to make it fully editable by the client.


## Design

We were approached by [BVD](http://bvd.se) to build the website for this project. BVD is an experienced design studio in Stockholm that focuses on simplicity and quality for their clients.

They showed us their design concept for the site, it included bold imagery from Stockholm and nice typography. They had us at hello.

## Experiments

The designs got us inspired and we immediately started experimenting in the browser. We prototyped few ideas, here is one we made for interactive statistics:

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="6678" data-slug-hash="Htoyz" data-default-tab="result" data-user="14islands" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/14islands/pen/Htoyz/'>Htoyz</a> by 14islands (<a href='http://codepen.io/14islands'>@14islands</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here is another one on a possible way to present building 
projects on premise: 

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="6678" data-slug-hash="BChpE" data-default-tab="result" data-user="14islands" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/14islands/pen/BChpE/'>Google panorama component</a> by 14islands (<a href='http://codepen.io/14islands'>@14islands</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Not all ideas made it into the project, but this got us onboard - making us happy campers.


## Laying the grounds

All content on the site is editable using the Wordpress content management system. One of the best thing about Wordpress is that it provides a nice experience for the editors that manage all the different types of content for the site.

Wordpress is even responsive, witch tones  well with how we built the site.

## Responsiveness

## Conclusion

Our job was to bring designs to live with interactivity and animations. This was only the first phase of the project so expect more to come.
