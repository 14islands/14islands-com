## 'Tis the Season

Weâ€™ve had the pleasure to build 16 interactive scenes for the calendar over the past two years. It's a fully responsive experience with lots of animations and playfulness.

<!--Each day &#8212; from December 1st to December 24th &#8212; you get to follow Santa and his elves as they prepare for Christmas.-->

Santa's village is the entry point to all the individual games and scenes. Each one is built as a separate App making it easier for the team to work in parallel.

## Decorations

The overall experience was directed by our friends [UPPERQUAD](http://upperquad.com). The design features colourful flat elements such as moving animals and elves in different colour outfits.

All design elements are vector based &#8212; a good approach to keep things flexible and resolution independent. As always, we made everything work on different kinds of devices, this year we even added support for Chromecast and Android Wear integration.

## Bringing it to life

Apart from coding the colourful characters and their surroundings, our job was to bring the whole experience to life.
Animations and interactions should feel natural and work nicely together to make scenes playful and as fun as possible.

Many of the scenes were fully fledged games, such as the matching game where you play against the clock to beat santa on his own playfield. We built the logic for these games with multiple levels and score keeping.

We also integrated with many cool Google services such as the Street View Panorama and the Text-to-Speech API. The translations scene lets you listen to your favourite holiday greetings in 20 different languages &#8212; including Elvish.

## Technologies

As always, when working with Google, we got to play with a lot of new toys. This year Santa's factory was upgraded to use Web Components (using Polymer) and the new Web Animations specification. <!--Read more about our [thoughts on Web Animations on the blog](#)-->
