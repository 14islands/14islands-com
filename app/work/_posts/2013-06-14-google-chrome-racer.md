## About

Racer is a chrome experiment by Google Creative Lab, where you and your friends line up your phones or tablets to create a scalectrix-like race track across several screens.

We teamed up with [Plan8](http://plan8.se) to create a dynamic music and sound experience out of an original composition by Giorgio Moroder. It features dynamic engine sound, and other race effects, but more importantly a dynamic music mix that spreads out over all connected devices.
