## About

As web developers that build responsive web sites, we experience the same problem on every project.

We do all the responsible “responsive” things. We start with the content, prototype in the browser, build mobile first and enhance the experience for bigger screens.

Life is good, until we have to deal with images.


## The elephant in the room

Most responsive websites send huge images to small screens resulting in slow performance, wasted bandwidth and a bad user experience.

Just look at these numbers:

> 60% of all web traffic is images

> 69% of mobile web traffic is images
> -- <cite>[Source](http://mobile.httparchive.org/interesting.php#bytesperpage)</cite>

> 57% will abandon a site after waiting 3 seconds for a page to load
> -- <cite>[Source](http://www.radware.com/Products/FastView/?utm_source=strangeloop&utm_medium=slforward&utm_campaign=slmoving)</cite>

> 87% of mobile users expect sites to load at least as fast, or faster than on their desktop.
> -- <cite>[Source](http://www.radware.com/Products/FastView/?utm_source=strangeloop&utm_medium=slforward&utm_campaign=slmoving)</cite>

We should be loading optimized images for every screen. However, web standards don’t provide an easy way to do this without resorting to complicated client and server-side techniques.

Let’s be honest, on most projects we don’t have the time to solve it in a proper way as we are usually busy building awesome websites.

## A better way

This is why we built responsive.io, to solve this problem once and for all.

responsive.io automatically resizes and optimizes images on the fly, delivering perfect sizes for every screen. We serve high resolution images for retina and high density screens. We convert images to WebP (currently only supported in Chrome), progressive JPG and use other clever optimizations to reduce the image file size.

Speed is important, responsive.io caches all images on a global Content Delivery Network (CDN), making sure that images load from a location near you. After a resized image has been served once, the next delivery will be blazing fast.

## Technology

responsive.io is a SaaS (Software as a service) product built from start to finish by 14islands. We picked the best technology for each job.

- **Ruby on Rails** for website and dashboard for users
- **NodeJS** for fast image processing
- **Sass** for CSS pre-processing
- **CoffeeScript** for JavaScript pre-processing
- **Linode** for server hosting
- **Paymill** to handle payments and subscriptions 
- **Mandrill** to send out transactional emails
- **MailChip** to send out email newsletter to subscribers
- **CloudFlare** as a CND (Content Delivery Network)

We also took care of many other different aspects: strategy, design, writing content, promoting, user support, server setup and monitoring, writing terms and policies with help from lawyers among other things.



## Conclusion

There are many happy customers using responsive.io and we use it on our own project for performance. 

Happy responsivizing!
