#### Our own service for responsive websites to deliver perfect images for every screen.

## About

As web developers that build responsive web sites, we experience the same problem on every project.

We do all the responsible “responsive” things. We start with the content, prototype in the browser, build mobile first and enhance the experience for bigger screens.

Life is good, until we have to deal with images.


## The elephant in the room

Most responsive websites send huge images to small screens resulting in slow performance, wasted bandwidth and a bad user experience.

Just look at these numbers:

> 60% of all web traffic is images

> 69% of mobile web traffic is images

> 57% will abandon a site after waiting 3 seconds for a page to load

> 87% of mobile users expect sites to load at least as fast, or faster than on their desktop.

We should be loading optimized images for every screen. However, web standards don’t provide an easy way to do this without resorting to complicated client and server-side techniques.

Let’s be honest, on most projects we don’t have the time to solve it in a proper way as we are usually busy building awesome websites.

## A better way

This is why we built responsive.io, to solve this problem once and for all.

responsive.io automatically resizes and optimizes images on the fly, delivering perfect sizes for every screen. We serve high resolution images for retina and high density screens. We convert images to WebP (currently only supported in Chrome), progressive JPG and use other clever optimizations to reduce the image file size.

Speed is important, responsive.io caches all images on a global Content Delivery Network (CDN), making sure that images load from a location near you. After a resized image has been served once, the next delivery will be blazing fast.


## The responsive.io philosophy

Our goal is to make it easier to build responsive web sites by serving perfect images as fast as possible. We all have more important things to focus on then re-inventing the wheel.

Let us do the hard work so you can focus on your website.
We don’t apply watermarks on your images. We don’t use user-agent sniffing, cookies or other shaky techniques to resize images. Instead, we use feature detection of browser capabilities to make sure we are future proof.

responsive.io respects styles applied to each image element. It doesn’t force you to specify any custom style attributes, instead it picks up the style you’ve already specified using normal CSS or image attributes.

In essence, images should behave as they would without the service, with the addition of better performance, faster downloads and a greatly improved user experience.
