## About

Santa Tracker is a christmas calendar from Google that consists of 24 interactive scenes. From elves having a good time and doing some work to mini-games to keep you entertained.

We had the pleasure to collaborate on 9 scenes for this massive christmas environment with lots of fun.


## The designs

The whole experience was directed by our friends at [UENO](http://ueno.co). The design featured colourful flat elements such as moving animals and elves in different colour outfits.

Everything was vector based, a good approach to keep things flexible and resolution independent. We built everything responsive to make it look great all kinds of different devices.


## Bringing it to live

Building this design was a true joy. It was not uncommon to laugh about the scene because it was so captivating.

Say, an elf animation moving too fast because you are experimenting with the animation? “Haha - look at that elf!”.

Anyways, here are some bits & pieces from the project:

### Streets scene

Navigate around Santa-land as you would do with Street View in Google Maps.

### Airport scene

The elves re-appear fully clothed.

### Call from Santa

Chat with Santa as you would do on Google Hangouts.
