## Enter the Experience

The idea with the website is to present SPG and their real estate portfolio in a clear and  inspiring way. Simple structure, interactive elements and smooth transitions between pages make the user experience seamless.

The website supports multiple languages and is currently available in Swedish ([sgp.se](http://sgp.se)) and Norwegian ([spg.no](http://sgp.no)). Its made with WordPress so its fully editable by the people at SPG, and its built responsive to work well on mobile, tablets and desktop computers.

## Design

We were approached by [BVD](http://bvd.se) to build the website for this project. BVD is an experienced design studio in Stockholm that focuses on simplicity and quality for their clients.

## Injecting the spirit
The design immediately inspired us to start experimenting in the browser. This is a prototype we made to present interactive statistics:
{% endmarkdown %}
	</div>

	<div class="grid__row--wide u--margin-both--half">
		{% include work/sthlm6000/masking-number-animation.html %}
	</div>

	<div class="grid__row">
{% markdown %}
The donut chart is also a nice way display the statistics, bringing the numbers to life in a more visual way.
{% endmarkdown %}
	</div>

	<div class="grid__row--wide u--margin-both--half">
		{% include work/sthlm6000/donut-chart.html %}
	</div>

	<div class="grid__row">
{% markdown %}
We also experimented with playful ways of presenting building projects on premise using Google Street View.
{% endmarkdown %}
	</div>

	<div class="grid__row--wide u--margin-both--half">
		{% include work/sthlm6000/google-streetview-panorama.html %}
	</div>

	<div class="grid__row">
{% markdown %}
Not all ideas made it into the project but this process inspired the whole team to come up with new creative directions.
