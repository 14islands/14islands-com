# Elastica
Marketing site full of creative animations as you browse through the pages.

[Video]

## About

Elastica is a security startup based in Silicon Valley, San Francisco. Their mission is to provide companies elegantly simple solutions for security in the cloud. 

Part of their journey was to build a great website to present their services, thats were we came in. We ended up crafting over 20 animations on the site to tell their story.

## Design

We were approached by [UENO](http://ueno.co) for this project. UENO is a leading web design agency, serving clients such as Google, Dropbox, Fitbit, Medium and AirBnb.

We were proud to help, specially when seeing the creativity and ambitions put into their designs. 


## What we built 

Letâ€™s take a look at some of the animations we built throughout the process.
