# Open Position: UX / Interaction Designer

We are looking for an interaction designer to join our team. A creative mind who believes great user experiences can be both coherent and playful at the same time. A person that likes to communicate with clients, facilitate workshops and do hands-on prototyping in collaboration with our designers and developers.

You have good understanding of visual hierarchy and knowledge of usability best practices. You care about details and believe that brand values are expressed through micro-interactions as part of the overall user experience.

Our team has many years of experience in the digital field. You’ll join us full-time in our office in Stockholm and together we’ll grow as people, professionals and as a group.

## I’m excited, what to do next?

Glad you asked, drop a line to [jobs@14islands.com](mailto:jobs@14islands.com) and tell us a bit about yourself. Share some work you have done, maybe a portfolio or a Dribbble/Behance account. We look forward to hearing from you!
