# Open Position: UX / Experience Designer

We are looking for an experience designer to join our team. A creative mind who believes great user experiences can be both coherent and enjoyable at the same time. A person that is used to conduct user research and facilitate workshops. Someone who likes to communicate with clients, and do hands-on prototyping in collaboration with our team.

You have good understanding of visual hierarchy and knowledge of usability best practices. You care about details and believe that brand values are expressed through micro-interactions as part of the overall user experience.

We are a nimble company which means you will be a big part in our projects and get an opportunity to both prototype and iterate until final production.

Our team has many years of experience in the digital field. You’ll join us full-time in our office in Stockholm and together we’ll grow as people, professionals and as a group.

We believe in quality over quantity and always set the bar high for the work we produce.

## I’m excited, what to do next?

Glad you asked, drop a line to [jobs@14islands.com](mailto:jobs@14islands.com) and tell us a bit about yourself. Share some work you have done, maybe a portfolio or a Dribbble/Behance account. We look forward to hearing from you!
