# Open Position: Creative Web Developer

We are looking for a web developer who is enthusiastic to build great things. A person that enjoys working with emerging technologies and has a genuine interest to build enjoyable experiences for people.

We want a creative developer with a keen eye for animations and design. You should be specialised in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but also happy to dive into back-end tools such as NodeJS, Ruby on Rails and Headless CMS systems. It’s a big plus if you have experience with other creative technologies such as 3D, VR, AR and Web Audio.

We are a small company which means you will be a big part in our projects and get an opportunity to both develop and iterate until final production.

Our team has many years of experience in the digital field. You’ll join us full-time in our office in Stockholm. We are always looking into ways to improve, we even reserve one day for each week to experiment, learn new tools and make sure we stay on top of things.

We believe in quality over quantity and always set the bar high for the work we produce.

## I’m excited, what to do next?

Glad you asked, drop a line to [jobs@14islands.com](mailto:jobs@14islands.com) and tell us a bit about yourself. Share some code examples with us, maybe your Github page or Codepens you’ve done. We look forward to hearing from you!
