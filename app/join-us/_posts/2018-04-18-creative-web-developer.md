# Open Position: Creative Web Developer

We are looking for a web developer who is enthusiastic to build great things. A person that enjoys working with emerging technologies and has a genuine interest to build enjoyable experiences for people.

We want someone specialised in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but also happy to dive into back-end tools such as NodeJS, Ruby on Rails and Headless CMS systems. As such, you will join our team full-time in our office close to Mariatorget in Södermalm, Stockholm.

Our team of designers and developers has many years of experience in the digital field. You’ll be part of the team and together we’ll grow as people, professionals and as a group. We are always looking into ways to improve, we even reserve one day for each week to experiment, learn new tools and make sure we stay on top of things.

We believe in quality over quantity and always set the bar high for the work we produce.

## I’m excited, what to do next?

Glad you asked, drop a line to [jobs@14islands.com](mailto:jobs@14islands.com) and tell us a bit about yourself. Share some code examples with us, maybe your Github page or Codepens you’ve done. We look forward to hearing from you!
