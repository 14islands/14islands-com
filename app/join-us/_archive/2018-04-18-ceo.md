# We want to hire a CEO

The title of this job posting should really be “CEO/HR/Producer/Office Manager/Swiss Army Knife”, but we thought that would scare you away. So, now that you are already reading, let’s be honest.

As a small company it’s hard to stay focused on both the long term strategy and day-to-day operations. We also need to put out stunningly awesome work every now and then to pay the bills.

We finally realised we are great at what we do best; development and design - and less great at growing a company at the same time.

Your role will be cross-functional since we are a small team.

Long term responsibilities:

* Help us refine and work towards our business goals
* Cultivating relationships with existing and potential clients
* Oversee ongoing projects and planning
* Making sure the team is thriving
* Accounting duties

Examples of near term tasks:

* Finding a new office space where we can continue to grow
* Hiring new employees

Minimal Requirements:

* Two years of experience in a similar role
* Knowledge of the design & digital studio business
* Longing to have fun and to build a great company

If this sounds interesting, please say [hello](mailto:jobs@14islands.com).

Do you feel like we have unreasonable expectations? We are happy to discuss your role and what you can contribute with.
