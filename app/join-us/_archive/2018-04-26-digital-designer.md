# Open Position: Digital Designer

You love to imagine and craft experiences on the web. You think a beautiful design starts with a solid concept. You can spend hours on details because you know they make all the difference in the world. Above all, you are the kind person that wants to work in close collaboration with a talented team. Nice to meet you!

We are looking for an experienced creative mind to join us. We are a small company which means you will be a big part in our projects and get an opportunity to both prototype and iterate until final production.

You should feel comfortable using Sketch, the Adobe Creative Suite and your favourite prototyping tools. On some projects we also create 2D interface animations, other times we do 3D modelling for VR and WebGL experiences. We refresh brands for the digital world and sometimes we write blog posts to share something cool we just learned.

Our team of designers and developers has many years of experience in the digital field. You’ll join us full-time in our office in Stockholm and together we’ll grow as people, professionals and as a group.

## I’m excited, what to do next?

Glad you asked, drop a line to [jobs@14islands.com](mailto:jobs@14islands.com) and tell us a bit about yourself. Share some work you have done, maybe a portfolio or a Dribbble/Behance account. We look forward to hearing from you!
