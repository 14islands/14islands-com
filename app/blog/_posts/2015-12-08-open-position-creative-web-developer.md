# Creative Web Developer

We are looking for a web developer that is enthusiastic to build great things.  We want a person that enjoys working with emerging technologies and has a genuine interest to build enjoyable experiences for people.

We want someone specialised with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but also happy to dive into back-end tools such as NodeJS, WordPress and Rails.  A person to join our team full-time in our office close to Mariatorget in Södermalm, Stockholm.

Our small team of developers has many years of experience in the digital web field.  You’ll be part of the team and together we’ll grow as people, professionals and as a group. We are always looking into ways to improve, we even reserve one day for each week to experiment, learn new tools and make sure we stay on top of things. 

We believe in quality over quantity and always set the bar high for the work we produce.

## I’m excited, what to do next?

Glad you asked, drop a line to [jobs@14islands.com](mailto:jobs@14islands.com) and tell us a bit about yourself. Pass on some code examples, maybe even your Github page or Codepens you’ve done. We look forward to hearing from you!
