# New Branding

When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were starting out in a garage, their skills made them stronger as a team. Jobs was a visionary and had the business knowledge. Wozniak was the guy who loved to play with technologies and he knew how to build computers.

At 14islands, we are a bit like Wozniak. We work with designers, agencies and businesses to help them build the things they envision. In our case, itâ€™s responsive websites, progressive web apps, 3D games and other experiences for people.

Our new identity had to reflect this and who we are as a creative development studio; How we love to play with technologies and to build delightful experiences. That we care about our craft and are ready to push things forward.

## A solid ground

Even though our team is all from different parts of the planet, we met each other here in Stockholm, Sweden.  Stockholm is a beautiful city spread across 14 islands - hence our name.

The islands can be represented with abstract shapes.

The shapes.

Putting those fourteen shapes together on a grid and our name is able to form.

## Our new logo

Say hello to our new logo.

Well crafted and playful. Just how we like it *ðŸ˜ƒ*{: class="emoji"}

## Colours

The colours are inspired by nature in the different countries we come from.

## Typography

The primary typeface in our identity is [Aften Screen](https://monokrom.no/fonts/aften).  Aften is specially designed to perform well on digital screens.

Secondary font is [Alma Mono](http://almamono.com/).  Alma Mono is a monospace typeface created to help out with relief & charity efforts.

## In Action

Our new identity is already in use on this website.  We also got brand new business cards, stickers and stuff around our office.

Other things are in the making; signs for the office, tote bags and such. We canâ€™t wait and will post those on our [Instagram page](instagram.com/14islands/) as soon as it arrives.

The identity was designed by [Bedow](http://www.bedow.se/).
