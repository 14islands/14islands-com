# New Branding

We believe that great user experiences are what sets companies apart in the digital age.

Our new identity had to reflect this belief and who we are as a creative development studio; How we love to play with technologies and build delightful experiences. That we care about our craft and are ready to push things forward.

We like to present you with our new branding and the idea behind it.

## A solid ground

Even though our team is all from different parts of the planet, we met each other here in Stockholm, Sweden.  

Stockholm is a beautiful city spread across 14 islands - hence our name.

The islands can be represented with abstract shapes.

{% include post-image.html alt="Map of Stockholm with the 14 islands as abstract shapes" caption="true" src="/images/blog/2017-04-21-new-branding/stockholm-map-with-shapes_16_7.jpg" margin="both" ratio="16_7" %}

{% include post-image.html alt="The fourteen islands as shapes" caption="true" src="/images/blog/2017-04-21-new-branding/shapes_16_9.jpg" margin="both" ratio="16_9" %}

Putting those fourteen shapes together on a grid and our name is able to form.

## Say hello to our new logo.

{% include post-image.html alt="Our new logo, created with the fourteen islands" caption="true" src="/images/blog/2017-04-21-new-branding/new-logo_16_9.jpg" margin="both" ratio="16_9" %}

Well crafted and playful. Just how we like it *ðŸ˜ƒ*{: class="emoji"}

## Colours

The colours are inspired by nature in the different countries we come from.

## Typography

The primary typeface in our identity is [Aften Screen](https://monokrom.no/fonts/aften).  Aften is specially designed to perform well on digital screens.

Secondary font is [Alma Mono](http://almamono.com/).  Alma Mono is a monospace typeface created to help out with relief & charity efforts.

## In Action

Our new identity is already in use on this website.  We also got brand new business cards, stickers and stuff around our office.

Other things are in the making; signs for the office, tote bags and such. We canâ€™t wait and will post those on our [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/14islands//) as soon as they arrive.

The identity was designed by [Bedow](http://www.bedow.se/).
