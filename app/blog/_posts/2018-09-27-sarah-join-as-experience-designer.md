We would like to announce that Sarah Lee has joined 14islands as a Senior Experience Designer.

With many years of experience within digital, she has been part of diverse teams dedicated on shaping outstanding products & services for different clients such as Volvo, ICA, &OtherStories, Save the Children, Swedbank and Ericsson. She never brags about it though, being a very nice and humble Canadian person. Or, we shall specify French-Canadian *ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦*{: class="emoji"}

Sarah worked as an Interaction Designer at Fjord in Stockholm for many years as well as an Experience Designer at R/GA in both London and Stockholm. She studied Digital Creative Strategy at Academy of Art University in San Fransisco and Interactive Communication at Berghs School of Communication in Sweden.

At 14islands, we are about making experiences that both look and work great, by providing design and development in one place. With Sarah joining, we can further help our clients form a solid strategy based on user & business insights, shape visions that evolves and scales with our clients as well as take a more human-centred design approach to our challenges.

We are very excited about this new chapter in our life as a digital studio, and want to take this opportunity to warmly welcome Sarah as a member of our team!
