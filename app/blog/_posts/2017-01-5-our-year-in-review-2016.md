# Our year in review - 2016

*What a year! It’s time to look back and reflect on what just happened.*

We feel humbled to have attracted such amazing clients and projects over the years. At some points we’ve had to turn down interesting projects due to “only” being a team of three developers. This year we made a decision to start looking for a new digital talent to join our team.

As we approached March, Marco had been working remotely from Brazil for a few months and we decided it was time for a grand reunion. So, we all jumped on a plane and decided to meet half way..

## Off to Texas

We had found the perfect meeting spot - [SXSW Interactive in Austin, Texas](http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/) . The conference featured lots of amazing talks and smart people in our industry. We wrote a [piece on the current trends today](https://14islands.com/blog/2016/03/24/trends-at-sxsw-interactive-2016/).

The outcome is that we are living a very exciting digital phase in history right now. Talk about to start the year inspired!

## What we do best

We worked on the [Plume website](https://14islands.com/work/plume-wifi/) with our friends at [North Kingdom](http://www.northkingdom.com/); built a [new company website](https://14islands.com/work/bedow/) for our neighbours [Bedow](http://www.bedow.se/); did a campaign site with [Audible in Germany](http://www.audible.de/); worked on many exciting projects with our smashing buddies at [Fjord](https://www.fjordnet.com/); made a [product configurator](https://www.stokke.com/GBR/en-gb/configurator?cid=stokke-xplory#!?cid=stokke-xplory) with our new client [Stokke](https://www.stokke.com); and many other projects.

At this moment we are cooking one of the coolest projects we’ve worked on yet, with an army of digital talents. More about that later.

## Adventures

Marco visited an old friend who lives in Australia. In this trip he also had the chance to give talks and meet one of our good clients, [Montgomery, in Sydney](http://www.montinvest.com/).

Hjörtur visited friends living in Malawi, Africa, and took a Safari trip in Zambia with his family.

David thought it was a good idea to buy a small sailing boat without knowing how to sail. He also went looking for polar bears in Svalbard.

## Culture Bible

We made time to write [Our Handbook](https://14islands.com/handbook/) as a reference of who we are and how we run things as a company. We believe writing openly can benefit both us and the community.

## And by the way… we did hire!

Welcome Natalia! She is a graduate from Copenhagen School of Design & Technology and holds a Bachelor degree in Web Development and AP degree in Multimedia Design. We are super happy that she found her way to us, and we already feel like a stronger team.

**Could you share a little about you in under VARCHAR(255) characters?**
<br>
I’m 24, come from Poland but spent the last 6 years in Copenhagen studying and bartending. I love Vietnamese food, analogue cameras, traveling to faraway places and.. Harry Potter. Crazy and colourful designs with a hint of magic are my absolute favourite to work with.

**What excites you about web development?**
<br>
The fact that there’s always something new and fun to explore. What gets me really excited right now is creating crystal balls, flying donuts and other crazy things that [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) has to offer.

**Can you make it through the Swedish winter?**
<br>
Let’s see, this will be the first one!

**Abba, Zlatan or Alfred Nobel?**
<br>
Alfred, of course. Gotta stick with the nerds ;)

## On the edge

A good way to stay on top of technologies is to create time for hacks and experiments. We did a hack called [Aeronaut](https://14islands.com/blog/2016/11/04/webvr-with-threejs/) to experiment with WebGL and WebVR. Another more useful hack is an app called [vecka.14islands.com](https://14islands.com/blog/2016/12/15/vecka-progressive-web-app/) which we built to try out the latest [Progressive Web App technologies](https://14islands.com/blog/2016/05/29/progressive-web-apps-catching-up-on-mobile/).

We have continued to share open source libraries on [Github](https://github.com/14islands) and playful [Codepens](http://codepen.io/14islands) this year. We wrote a number of [blog posts](https://14islands.com/blog) and shared countless happenings on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/14islands/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/14islands/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/14islands). We’ve also given talks to share some behind the scenes of our work.

## Meet our new office

Up until this point we’ve had the pleasure to share space with [Plan8](http://plan8.se/). We’ll always remember the good times we had there as we were growing up as a company. Now it’s time to step it up a notch.

Meet the new 14islands Headquarters. We are super happy about it. It’s a humble and cozy space in the same building as before in the [hipster part of town](https://www.google.se/maps/place/14islands/@59.3173821,18.0536417,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465f9e8a15555555:0xe1d19c2b5224dcb2!8m2!3d59.3173821!4d18.0558304?hl=en). We are currently in the phase of decorating, making coffee and buying toilet paper. It’s gonna be great.

## Julfest at Yasuragi

When it draws close to Christmas every year we have a celebration. We usually seek out Swedish traditions, but this time we went Japanese style at [Yasuragi](http://yasuragi.se/en/). Yasuragi is a Spa Hotel located in the archipelago near Stockholm.

Hot bath in a cold weather. The contrast might surprise you but it’s pleasantly relaxing. A few activities and snaps of sake later and our energies were fully recharged for the winter.

## 2017 is here!

Our sixth year in business is upon us. We want to take this opportunity to thank all our friends, partners and you for a great run so far.

We wish you an amazing year!
