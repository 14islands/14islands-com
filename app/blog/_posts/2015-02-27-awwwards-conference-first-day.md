# Awwwards conference 
## First day highlights

*We had the chance to attend the [Awwwards](http://conference.awwwards.com/) conference this year - a great event about web design in Barcelona. This the first post of a two day series*.

—

[Awwwards](http://conference.awwwards.com/) is an organisation that aims to recognise and share the most inspiring projects around the world. It consists of a talented jury who promotes projects with awards on different web design categories. Every year they host a conference with different talks and a prize-giving ceremony.

This year the conference was held in the beautiful Barcelona.

You can find some talk highlights of the first day below.

### Real artists ship
**Haraldur Thorleifsson ([@hthorleifsson](http://twitter.com/hthorleifsson))**

Our friend “Halli” started the presentation by asking all designers in the room who had a good project but that actually hasn’t been shipped. Many hands were raised and the point of the talk was made.

> Photoshop is like a fake world that we create for ourselves.

Hali recommends following a set of rules for delivering good design work:

- Test
- Create your own wireframes
- Photoshop lies
- Only deal with decision makers

### Responsive images
**Bruce Lawson ([@brucel](http://twitter.com/brucel))**

Bruce provided a humorous talk on the technical subject of responsive images.

> Safari is the North Korea of browsers. They don’t usually say what they are working on.

Responsive initially meant quick to react. Speed is part of responsive. Images are most part of the website and they are not inadequately responsive.

He emphasised the importance of keeping the responsive images solution in the HTML instead of Javascript.

One example was Opera Mini browser, where the user can actually turn on a setting to get low quality images. That could probably fail for websites  with images relying on some Javascript logic. A browser knows things that you as a developer can’t possible know.

Decoding and de-compressing images takes previous time in all browsers and so it’s important that user gets the correct image size.

There a few updates on responsive images being shipped to browsers lately: `<picture>, srcset, sizes.`

### Side Projects are Stupid
**Tobias Van Schneider ([@schneidertobias](http://twitter.com/))**

Tobias encourages having side projects and the importance of keeping them simple.

> Side projects are stupid because they have to be simple.

He shares his five principles on taking on a side project:

1. Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)
2. Ignore everybody
3. Trust your gut
4. Being a jack of all trades
5. Stay busy 
Some projects were being shown that were “stupid” but that actually gave a lot of experience while doing it. Having no clear plan on an idea can end paying off in the long run.

Doing something just to make people laugh can also work as a good project goal.

### Empathy
**Meagan Fisher ([@HvassHannibal](http://twitter.com/))**

Meagan spoke of the importance of Empathy on design. How to consider the user feelings when designing something.

> Make sure to get close to your users and use it as an ongoing part of your process.

Real human needs are the most valuable constraint we have.

An experiment was made with Coca-cola back in the days where they have added more salt, sugar and caffeine in their old recipe expecting to increase sales. It did not. People got furious about changing their more-than-one-hundred-year-old  taste and protested.

Don’t fail to consider what yours users want. Coke did not understand the deep emotions of so many of their customers and so their old Coke taste came back.

Ask the users if they want it new before doing it. Users are not that tolerant to changes.

Meet users and have meaningful conversations with them. Make sure to get close to them and use it as an ongoing part of your process. Get feedback when they use your product and when they leave it. Be personal and try to connect with them in a more emotional level.

### Designing with Chrome DevTools
**Paul Bakaus ([@pbakaus](http://twitter.com/))**

In one of the most interesting talks of the day, Paul Kabaus from Google shared some features that are coming to Chrome DevTools soon.

> The first rule of upcoming features is to not talk about upcoming features.

Paul mentioned that DevTools team has been trying to be ahead of the trend curve and haven’t succeeded until now.

For instance, when the “border-radius” finally got browser prefix-free, people stopped using it. The same thing with background gradients and so on.

But now they finally reached that point of staying ahead with some DevTools animations features. The animations panel is a great step ahead and it caused some applauses and gasps from the audience.

You will now be able to slow down animations, change their easing with a nice inline bezier-curve visualisation tool and even review all the properties that are being animates in a nice timeline frame fashion.

Devotees is actually an open source project and Paul asked for feedback if somebody ever got an idea that would like to share.

Finally, the DevTools team just got themselves a designer for the first time and that is exiting news as we can expect the DevTools to look more user friendly and have a better look and feel. [@maxwkr](http://twitter.com/maxwkr) is the new designer dedicated to DevTools.

The DevTools team is focusing on keeping the interface more usable by adding more “SCRIM” to it:

- Smart
- Colorful
- Responsive
- Intuitive
- Material

#### Responsive Web Typography
**Marko Dugonjić ([@markodugonjic](http://twitter.com/markodugonjic))**

Marko shared some tips on responsive typography that goes beyond  changing sizes on breakpoints. He mentioned how we should be aware of reading distance, letter and word spacing and how we can influence a better reading experience.

#### Betting on the Web to #Win
**Phil Hawksworth ([@philhawksworth](http://twitter.com/philhawksworth))**

Phil shared a great talk with some exccelent slides on how we are going forward with the web. Interesting examples and concepts compared from the past to present and how we are keeping up with all the trends and innovation changes.
