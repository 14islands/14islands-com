# Awwwards conference - second day highlights

The second day of the conference successfully kept the momemtum that we have experienced in the previous day. Talks highlights of the second day can be found below.

## Collaboration - Making/Thinking/Illustrating Together
**Sofie Hannibal ([@HvassHannibal](http://twitter.com/HvassHannibal))**

Sofia showed the inspiring work behind [Hvass&Hannibal
](http://www.hvasshannibal.dk/) - a Danish arts and design studio based in Copenhagen.

She also shared the questions and challenges - that often took them outside of their comfort zone - that her small studio faced with time.

> "A feeling of quality of our work is the amount of time we are willing to expend on it but also the fact that we are willing to take chances while doing it."

Very honest and interesting to see the process and thoughts behind each presented project.

## Enhance!
**Jeremy Keith ([@adactio](http://twitter.com/adactio))**

Jeremy Keith started the talk by saying he wanted to change our minds by rewinding our brain. Small symbols and figures that are usually hidden but when told by somebody get very hard to un-see it.

After some examples of “rewinding the brain” he got to the point of the talk: to makes us see what Progressive Enhancement is supposed to be.

> "The web doesn’t work as a platform. If you put something in the web everyone will get access to something if you build it in the right way. It’s not all or nothing."

We need to count to what we can’t predict. When an escalator fails, it becomes stairs. We need to build more escalators. HTML and CSS are both fault tolerant where as JavaScript is not.

During the talk he often asked to question “Do websites need to look exactly the same in every browser?” [The answer is NO](http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/).

## No guts, No glory
**Henry Daubrez ([@upskydown](http://twitter.com/upskydown))**

Dogstudio shared the importance of their culture and how that affected their work.

> "Everybody in the company has dog nicknames."

They really value having fun while doing work and that was shown on the presentation by how having fun and taking bold decisions helped shape and drive the company to where it is at the moment.

Dog studio won the Developer Awwward on the [Dragone project](http://www.dragone.com/).

## Responsive Design: Current State of Affairs and Where do we go from here?
**Divya Manian ([@divya](http://twitter.com/divya))**

Divya started the presentation by giving an overview on Responsive Web Design.

> "The current tools today are not sufficient to address Responsive Web Design."

During the talk she mentioned how she was using Photoshop layer comps as a presentation tool and showed off some useful improvements that are getting in such as [Column Guide Layouts](http://blogs.adobe.com/jkost/2014/10/new-guide-layout-and-new-guide-from-shape-in-photoshop-cc.html) for grid design and [Smart Object Links](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/photoshop-linked-smart-objects.html) for better maintainability.

The highlight of the talk was a short demo with the [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) tool and how that can get integrated with a PSD file.


## The Web in the age of WebGL
**Ricardo Cabello ([@mrdoob](http://twitter.com/mrdoob)) & Jaume Sanchez ([@thespite](http://twitter.com/thespite))**

One of the most awaited talks of day, Ricardo and Jaume showed how WebGL started on 2011, when we were finally been able to access the GPU, and where it is heading today. Their work has been greatly pushing the WebGL technology forward.

> "Very happy to have been able to share 3 dreams of black as a [open source project](https://github.com/dataarts/3-dreams-of-black)."

Some pretty impressive experiments were shown, among them the experimental site for the “Gravity” movie. The way how WebGL is entering the Virtual Reality field is very exciting. [WebVR](http://webvr.info/) is the api for virtual reality on the web.

Mr.Doob (Ricardo) was also proud to show a new [open-source Three.js editor](http://threejs.org/editor/) that he has been working on and that will allow you to work with WebGl 3D graphics in the browser and get a nice copy-and-paste code output.

## Where we’re going we don’t need roads
**David Navarro ([@davidnavarro](http://twitter.com/davidnavarro)) & Claudio Guglieri ([@claudioguglieri](http://twitter.com/claudioguglieri))**

This presentation was the most impressive and unconventional one of the event.

It started with a great mashup video of famous movies that have been giving their take or influencing design interface.

> "The human body is the next computer interface."

Claudio and David mention how “responsive” should mean more than just adapting to different screen sizes and used many movies as example throughough the presentation.

Interfaces should interact with human emotions through: Speech, Vision and Touch.


## Other talks of the day:

### Javascript <3 Unicode
**Mathias Bynens ([@mathias](http://twitter.com/mathias))**

Javascript has problems on how it handles Unicode characters - and they can be pretty funny. In the talk he walked through some problems and showed some upcoming ES6 features that will help solve this.

### Josh Holmes
([@joshholmes](http://twitter.com/joshholmes))

Josh talks about smart homes and how the “internet of things” is just a buzz word that has been around for a while. He passionately talked about hardware and how it’s evolving so fast nowadays.
