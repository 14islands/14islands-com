# A designer has landed on the islands

We are very happy to announce that Aline Kesting has joined the islands as a Senior Visual Designer. We have known Aline for a long time and been impressed with her amazing design skills and personality.

Aline was a Senior Designer at Fjord in Stockholm for many years and before that an Art Director at DigitasLBi in Paris. She studied multimedia design at Gobelins and has ever since made beautiful designs for brands such as Armani, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Sephora, as well as Digital Services for some of Swedenâ€™s biggest players in e-commerce and banking.

What makes Aline a great fit for 14islands is her experience with interactive designs. As a studio that loves to build user experiences, she complements our technology skills and makes it possible for us to help our partners on both digital designs and development.

We are happy to have Aline on-board and are looking forward to make even nicer things on the web.
