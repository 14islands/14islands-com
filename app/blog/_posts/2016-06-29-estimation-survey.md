# Estimation process survey

Small companies should always aim to have improved internal processes. Creating an estimation for a project is a great example on how automation could be able to help. Time spent efficiently can be crucial for 3 jack-of-all-trades partners like us at 14islands.

A few months ago we created a survey to find out more on how other companies do their estimation process.

The survey attracted 28 responses from different companies.

Let’s take a look at the results.

## What is the size of your agency?

{% include blog/estimation-survey/collision.html %}

The majority of our answers are from small agencies. That makes it even more interesting to us to get to know how other fellow small companies work.

## How many estimations do you usually perform every month?

{% include blog/estimation-survey/number-of-estimations.html %}

Big gap from the "1-5" estimation option to the others. Not unexpected as it aligns with the fact that we are hearing mostly from small companies.

## When you are estimating a project, what tool do you use to calculate the price?

{% include blog/estimation-survey/tools.html %}

Using a spread sheet software for the estimation? So do we!

## When you have your estimation ready, how do you share it with the client?

One of the most interesting results, there is a mix here of how the result is shared to the client.

## When you share your estimation, how is the final number presented?

Question related to the previous one. Again we see some mixed results on the presentation part.

## Do you see any way you could possibly automate or facilitate your estimation/offer process? How?

We selected 3 answers here that called our attention.

## If you could have a dream tool to help your estimation process, how would that tool be like? Any wishful feature?

We also selected 3 wishes here that we would like to share.
