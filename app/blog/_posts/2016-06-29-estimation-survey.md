# Estimation process survey

A few months ago we created a survey to find out more on how other companies do their estimation process.

The survey attracted *28* responses from different companies.

Let’s take a look at the results.

## What is the size of your agency?

{% include blog/estimation-survey/collision.html %}

The majority of our answers come from *1-10* employee agencies. Some from *10-20* and *20-50* as well.

## How many estimations do you usually perform every month?

<div class="js-component-blog-estimation-survey-pie-chart u-margin-both-half estimation-post-pie-chart"
     data-labels='["1-5 estimations", "More than 10 estimations", "10+. A LOT of estimations"]'
     data-values="[20, 5, 2]"
     data-type="pie">
</div>

Most of the companies that participated perform *1-5* estimations per month.

## When you are estimating a project, what tool do you use to calculate the price?

<div class="js-component-blog-estimation-survey-pie-chart u-margin-both-half estimation-post-pie-chart estimation-post-pie-chart--donut"
     data-labels='[
     	"A spreadsheet such as Excel or Google Sheets", 
     	"Pen, paper and a nice calculator.", 
     	"I don´t use anything, I just make up a number.", 
     	"Trello", 
     	"Notes / Google Docs", 
     	"A combination of tools / bespoke software"]'
     data-values="[18, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1]"
     data-type="donut">
</div>

Using a spread sheet to estimate seems to be the most common approach.

## When you have your estimation ready, how do you share it with the client?

<div class="js-component-blog-estimation-survey-pie-chart u-margin-both-half estimation-post-pie-chart estimation-post-pie-chart--donut"
     data-labels='[
     	"I simply write an email and send it away", 
     	"I craft a presentation using Keynote/Powerpoint", 
     	"I give them a call / meet and go over it",
     	"A Statement of Work (SOW)", 
     	"We use Vantage", 
     	"Contract system for WordPress", 
     	"Detailed description and offer of a presentation", 
     	"Other"]'
     data-values="[11, 8, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]"
     data-type="donut">
</div>

One of the most interesting results, there is a wide mix of how the result is shared with the client.

## When you share your estimation, how is the final number presented?

<div class="js-component-blog-estimation-survey-pie-chart u-margin-both-half estimation-post-pie-chart estimation-post-pie-chart--donut"
     data-labels='[
     	"One fixed total price", 
     	"One fixed price with descriptions of each task", 
     	"Divided in priced packages", 
     	"Ballpark of a minimum and maximum price.", 
     	"A combination of the above has been used"]'
     data-values="[5, 8, 4, 5, 5]"
     data-type="donut">
</div>

Question related to the previous one. Again we see some mixed results on the presentation part.

## Do you see any way you could possibly automate or facilitate your estimation/offer process? How?

We have selected a couple of answers that called our attention:

> “It's so simple, excel is fine.“

> “Unfortunately the estimation process is very different between projects.“

> “Yes we use T-shirt Sizing sometimes to quickly estimate.“

> “Most of the process is already automated, but you can't automate the insight and client specific notes that show that you care and really show interest in the project.“

> “No.“

*Thank you for participating!*
