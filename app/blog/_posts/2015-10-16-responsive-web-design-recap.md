# Responsive Web Design Recap

It's important to get the terminology right while collaborating with other agencies or wider teams.

As an opportunity to create an open discussion between designers and developers around what "Responsive Web Design" means, a  "popcorn" session was presented where we went through the key points and discussed the process with its challenges.

This talk is divided in:

- "What" Responsive Web Design is.
- "Why" do we care.
- "How" to do it (in a nutshell).

Hope you find it useful!
