# Trends at SXSW Interactive 2016

There are many trends happening at the moment. It was great to gain more clarity about these technologies and how they will impact us humans going forward. 

We would like to discuss some of these trends in this article:

* Conversational UIs
* Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality
* Robots, Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning

Lets dive into it.

## Convesational UIs

Today there is an app for most products and services we use. As more companies will become technology driven and  objects around us will become smarter;  Downloading an app to interact with all these these things is to time consuming, and requires to effort to manage.

One solution to this problem are chat bots and personal assistants that make it possible to communicate to services using our normal way of writing.


### Your personal assistant

An example of this is the ability to order an Uber through Facebook Messenger. You can click on an address that shows up in the chat and ask for an Uber. An Uber will show up and paid for with Facebook Messenger.  All that without leaving the chat thread or opening another app.

> Messaging apps have eclipsed social networks in usage.

We'll see more of these kind of interactions in messaging apps such as  Slack, Facebook Messenger, SMS, WeChat (Popular in China) and potentially Twitter.  They will allow us to transfer money, buy things and so forth, rigth in the chat.


### Make a connection, with a bot.

Lark is a personal coaching service that helps people reach their fitness goals. The interaction is fully experienced as a chat conversation.

Lark gets profile information using Facebook Connect and connects with Apple Healtkit to collect info from peoples phone and wearables such as the Apple Watch.

This makes it possible for Lark to give personalized advice, and by asking deeper questions about the user. The techology to understand peoples writing is still a bit limited. Lark will lead the conversation by suggesting answers. However, in the future bots will be smarter and and start to understand our natural language. They will feel just like a human being helping us out.

> 25% of people have said "I love you" to a bot


### Even more natural

Voice assistances such as Microsoft Cordana, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri and Google Now are also constantly getting better.

Expect the lines between physical and digital to blurry

Its the ability to interact with technology beyond the screen that is so exciting at the moment. There are other innovations  such sensors to detect changes in our enviroment.

Here is a fun video by Jared Ficklin demostrating this idea. He uses technologies to control the enviroment around him. Amazon Echo (Alexa) for voice recognizion, Kinnect to detect gestures and smart objects.

## Virtual Reality 

This year Virtual Reality (VR) was the talk of town in Austin. Long lines formed in front of Samsung and Google where these were being tried out.

### The Current State

Currently, the use of VR seems to be primarly in the field of gaming and visual experiences.  It also works great in combination with 360* video as it allows users to naturally look around as they are at the spot. 

Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Playstation VR will soon be shipped. These options are going to be quite expensive at the start, as an example  Oculus Rift has a $599 price tag, including accessories. Bets are on it will mainly gain traction for hard-core gamers will be ready to pay for it.

Samsung Gear and Google Cardboard are a less pricy option, they use mobile phones to drive the experience.  These devices do not provide the same premium experience as true virtual reality is hardware intence and they lack assessories such as built in headphones.


### The promise

The promise of VR is having the ability to enter another world from your living room. To be entertain and learn new things.

There is also potential for it being used as an utility. Google Tilt Brush in combination with HTC Vibe is an interesting example. It allows you to draw in 3D from different angles. I missed the oppertunity to try it at SXSW, but heard it was amazing. Users can do things such as bend down to paint from below.

An obvious limitation to VR is to strip a computer on your head and having to close yourself from the real world. Lets be honest, its a bit scary. Hopefully VR might become more social going forward. This is why Facebook is investing big in this area.

## Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality (AR) is also on the horizon. AR mixes the virtual with reality. You can see reality but digital structures and information will be mixed in for additional functions.

The best current example is Microsoft Hololens, they are about to ship a developer version of the device. It will be interesting to read the reviews about how far it has gotten.

More players will without a doubt entering this market. AG has huge potential, specially as an utility, for both day-to-day live and at work. The problem is that these devices will be big as a start and clumsy to carry around. It will  improve going forward. Just imagine when it becomes possible to fit AG into a lens in the future.

Apple are also likely to join the VR/AR category and have already made few hints about it. When Apple put the marketing engines ON, product categories are likely go mainstream.


## Robots, Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning

The robots are here. They might not look like the one in the movies. They usually perform limited number of tasks and look a bit less cooler.

We went to an interesting talk at SXSW by Jerry Kaplan about Robot, IA and jobs. Jerry has done research the field for the better part of his life. He sees robots, artifical intelligent and machine learning as part of a on-going evolution thats been happening for many years; Automation.

> Progress in IA is progress in automation.

In 1790, 96% of US jobs where in farming, because of automation this number is down to 1.9% today. Less people will be needed to for certain type of jobs today, as tasks are being automated by robots and artifical inteligent. At the same time, new fields with new kinds of jobs will be created, example are social marketing roles that did not exist few years back. Technology innovation, human touch and special talents will remain in demand.

In Austin we travelled between places using Uber/Lyft. These services remove the middle man from taking a “taxi”. The payment is even handled by the app so its just jumping in and out of the car. Pretty great experience.

It was fun chatting to the car drivers in Austin, but then you realise drivers might even be replaced by self-driving cars further in the future. This is a challange for all of us, to educate people for jobs that are needed in the future.
