# Trends at SXSW Interactive 2016

There are many trends happening at the moment. It was great to gain more clarity about these technologies and how they will impact us humans going forward. 

We would like to discuss some of these trends in this article:

* Conversational UIs
* Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality
* Robots, Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning

Lets dive into it.

## Convesational UIs

Today there is an app for most products and services we use. As more companies will become technology driven and  objects around us will become smarter;  Downloading an app to interact with all these things is time consuming, and requires much effort to manage.

One solution to this problem are chat bots and personal assistants that make it possible to communicate to services using our normal way of writing.


### Your personal assistant

An example of this is the ability to order an Uber through Facebook Messenger. You can click on an address that shows up in a chat and ask for a ride to that place. An Uber will show up and paid for with Facebook Messenger.  All that without leaving the chat thread or opening another app.

> Messaging apps have eclipsed social networks in usage.

We'll see more of these kind of interactions in messaging apps such as  Slack, Facebook Messenger, SMS, WeChat (Popular in China) and potentially Twitter.  They will allow us to transfer money, buy things and so forth, right from the chat.


### Make a connection, with a bot.

Lark is a personal coaching service that helps people reach their fitness goals. The interaction is fully experienced as a chat conversation.

Lark gets profile information using Facebook Connect and connects with Apple Healtkit to collect info from peoples phone and wearables such as the Apple Watch.

This makes it possible for Lark to give personalized advice, and by asking deeper questions about the user. The techology to understand peoples writing is still a bit limited. Lark will lead the conversation by suggesting answers. However, in the future bots will be smarter and and start to understand our natural language. They will feel just like a human being helping us out.

> 25% of people have said "I love you" to a bot


### Even more natural

Voice assistances such as Microsoft Cordana, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri and Google Now are also constantly getting better.

Expect the lines between physical and digital to blurry

Its the ability to interact with technology beyond the screen that is so exciting at the moment. There are other innovations  such sensors to detect changes in our enviroment.

Here is a fun video by Jared Ficklin demostrating this idea, using technologies to control the enviroment around him.

## Virtual Reality 

This year Virtual Reality (VR) was the talk of town at SXSW.  Currently the use of VR seems to be primarly for gaming and visual experiences. It also works great in combination with 360° video as it allows users to naturally look around as they are at the spot. 

Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Playstation VR will soon be shipped. These options are going to be quite expensive at the start, Oculus Rift has an $599 price tag including accessories as an example. Bets are on that VR hard-core gamers will mainly be ready to pay for it the beginning.

Samsung Gear and Google Cardboard are a less pricy option, they use mobile phones to drive the experience. These devices do not have the hardware to provide the same premium experience and they lack assessories such as built-in headphones.


### The promise

The promise of VR is having the ability to enter another world from your living room. To be entertain and learn new things.

There is also potential for it being used as an utility. [Google Tilt Brush](http://www.tiltbrush.com/) in combination with HTC Vibe is an interesting example. It allows you to draw in 3D from different angles. I missed the oppertunity to try it out but heard it was quote amazing. Users can do things such as bend down to paint from below.

An obvious limitation to VR is to strip a computer on your head and having to close yourself from the real world. Lets be honest, its a bit scary. Hopefully VR will become more social going forward, and thats of course why Facebook is investing heavy in this area.

## Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality (AR) is also on the horizon. AR mixes the virtual with reality. You can see reality with digital structures and information will be mixed in for additional functions.

The best current example is Microsoft Hololens, they are about to ship a developer version of the device. It will be interesting to read the reviews about how far it has gotten.

More players will without a doubt entering this market. AG has huge potential, specially as an utility, for both day-to-day live and at work. The problem is that these devices will be big as a start and clumsy to carry around. Its gonna improve, just imagine when it becomes possible to fit AG into a small lens further in the future.

Apple are also likely to join the VR/AR category and have already made few hints about it. When Apple put their marketing engines ON product categories are likely go mainstream.


## Robots, Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning

The robots are here. They might not look like the one in the movies. They usually perform limited number of tasks and look a bit less cooler.

We went to an interesting talk at SXSW by Jerry Kaplan about Robots, IA and jobs. Jerry has done research the field for the better part of his life. He sees robots, artifical intelligent and machine learning as part of a on-going evolution thats been happening for many years; Automation.

> Progress in IA is progress in automation.

In 1790, 96% of US jobs where in farming, because of automation this number is down to 1.9% today. Less people will be needed in todays world. Tasks are being automated by robots and artifical inteligent. At the same time, new fields with new types of jobs are created. A good example are social marketing roles that did not exist few years back. Technology innovation, human touch and special talents will remain in-demand. This is a challange for all of us, to educate people for jobs that are needed in the future.
