# Lessons learned using WordPress as a CMS

The very first WordPress Stockholm Meetup was held at Aftonbladet March 11th, 2015. We had the opportunity to speak at the Meetup and share our lessons learned on using WordPress as a CMS.

WordPress was initially designed as a blogging platform, but is now being used to drive content for full-blown websites. This talk explored ways to make WordPress work better as a CMS while building unique themes for clients.

[Video Recording from the event is available](http://bloggar.aftonbladet.se/utvecklingsbloggen/2015/03/19/presentations-event-photos-and-social-stats-wordpress-stockholm-meetup/) and our slides are displayed below.

Big thanks to everyone involved!
