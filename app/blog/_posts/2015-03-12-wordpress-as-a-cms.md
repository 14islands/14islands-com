# Lessons learned using WordPress as a CMS

The very first Wordpress Stockholm Meetup was held at Aftonbladet. We had an opportunity to speak at the Meetup and share our lessons learned on using Wordpress as a CMS.

WordPress was initially designed as a blogging platform, but is now being used to drive content for full-blown websites. This talk explored ways to make WordPress work better as a CMS while building unique themes for clients.

[Video Recording from the event](http://bloggar.aftonbladet.se/utvecklingsbloggen/2015/03/10/schedule-live-stream-wordpress-stockholm-meetup-wpsthlm/) is available (starts at 1:34) and flip through slides below.
